## **Social Network App**

**For login you can use my credentials:**
- Login: veng93@yandex.ru
- Password: 12345

Without logging in, you can only check the 'All users' and the 'About' tabs.
After five failed login attempts, you will see a captcha that needs to be solved.

## **Main information**

- On the 'Profile' tab, you can change your profile info, update status and photo. The API that was used does not allow you to save posts, so they are in the redux store.
- The 'Messages' tab is not working yet due to the same API capabilities. So you can only write messages in an improvised chat, without choosing a user.
- On the 'Friends' tab, you see a list of users you are followed to. You can go to each user's page by clicking on their name or photo.
- On the 'All users' tab, you can see all the Network users. You can go to each user's page and also click the button to follow or unfollow user.
